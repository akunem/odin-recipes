            <p>This coconut cake made with coconut milk is super moist and tasty. Growing up in Brazil, this was a favorite amongst our family and friends and even converted a few into coconut lovers. Enjoy it plain, or dress it up with your favorite glaze and toasted coconut.</p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
                <li>1 cup butter, softened</li>
                <li>4 large eggs, separated</li>
                <li>1 cup unsweetened shredded coconut</li>
                <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons baking powder</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch cake pan.</li>
                <li>Beat sugar, butter, and egg yolks together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy; add shredded coconut.</li>
                <li>Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Stir creamed butter mixture, alternating with coconut milk, into flour mixture until batter is just mixed.</li>
                <li>Beat egg whites in a glass or metal bowl until until soft peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the egg whites will form soft mounds rather than a sharp peak. Fold egg whites into batter. Pour batter into the prepared cake pan.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, about 45 minutes.</li>
            </ol>
